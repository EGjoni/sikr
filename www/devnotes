Dev Notes: 

We would probably like to refresh posts that have been made since the last index of a blog. However, we don't want to reindex
the entire blog every time we rescan. So we would probably want to keep incrementing the offset only UNTIL we hit a post id we've
seen before. However, this has potential to be tripped up if the user makes a post while our engine is indexing. Because we would then have 
gaps in the index. To this end, we probably want a "date_indexed" clumn. Where we only stop indexing if the post id has been seen 
before AND the difference between the current date and the date indexed is greater than whatever value turns out to be appropriate.  


It seems reblogs each have unique post ids and are tied together by reblog keys. Probably irrelevant for us.
